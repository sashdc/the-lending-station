# The Lending Station

## Description

This application is a database for a library that allows librarians to keep track of, add, update, and delete books, users, and reviews from their database. Readers are also able to login to keep track of the book they have, or are currently borrowing. 

The site is easy to navigate, and includes authorization controls to ensure that users must be logged in to use the site, and also that only admins are authorized to access certain pages.

To test out the site as an admin, use "Meer" as the username, and "dasamsam" for the password. To test out the site as a user, use "Pang" as the username, and "thebigpang" for a password.
